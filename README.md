# TuneTeaser 🎵

TuneTeaser is a "Name That Tune" style game where you test your music knowledge against your own Spotify playlists!

## How to Play
1.  **Login** with your Spotify Premium account.
2.  **Select a Playlist** from your library.
3.  **Listen** to a short snippet of a random song.
4.  **Guess** the song title!
    *   Incorrect guesses increase the snippet length (making it easier).
    *   Correct guesses win the round!

## Features
*   **Smart Matching**: Guesses don't need to be perfect (ignores case and punctuation).
*   **Dynamic Difficulty**: Snippets start short (2s) and grow longer if you're stumped.
*   **Play Your Way**: Works with any of your personal playlists.

## Requirements
*   **Spotify Premium**: Required for the Web Playback SDK to stream music directly in the browser.
*   **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (with DRM enabled).

## Tech Stack
*   React & TypeScript
*   Spotify Web Playback SDK
*   Material UI
